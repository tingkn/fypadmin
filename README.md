Welcome to the repository for my final year project!

# Project Overview
For my Final Year Project, I developed a web application named Plastic Recycle-It-Up. Plastic Recycle-It-Up is designed to support plastic recycling efforts by providing a platform with different features for both users and admins. This project has been an exciting opportunity for me to apply the knowledge and skills I have acquired throughout my academic journey.

# Code
The main codes for this project are located in the '**developer**' branch of this repository. You can navigate to the '**developer**' branch to explore and review the source code. It contains the latest updates and developments related to the project.

Despite initially having only gained basic knowledge of GitHub and Laravel during my internship, I took the initiative to self-learn and explore further in order to successfully complete this project. Although I may not be proficient in these tools yet, I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills and expanding my knowledge.

Feel free to explore the repository, review the code, and any additional resources or documentation available. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
